## Healthy Chicken Caesar

* 1 lemon
* 15 g Parmesan cheese
* 2 anchovy fillets in oil
* 4 heaped tablespoons natural yoghurt
* ½ teaspoon English mustard
* 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
* white wine vinegar
* extra virgin olive oil
* 1 small red onion
* ½ a small cauliflower (300g)
* 1 romaine lettuce
* olive oil
* 1 sprig of fresh rosemary
* 2 x 120 g free-range skinless chicken breasts
* 1 thick slice of wholemeal bread

1. Finely grate the lemon zest and Parmesan into a large bowl. Slice and add the anchovies, along with the yoghurt, mustard and Worcestershire sauce.
1. Squeeze in half the lemon juice, add 1 tablespoon of vinegar and 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and mix to make your dressing.
1. Now you’re going to turn regular salad into a thing of beauty by either taking your time with good knife skills, or ideally, investing in a mandolin for ease, elegance and accuracy (use the guard!). Start by peeling and very finely slicing the red onion, then stir it through the dressing.
1. Click off and discard any tatty outer leaves from the cauliflower, then very finely slice it. Finely slice the lettuce by hand and pile both on top of the dressed onion, tossing together only moments before serving.
1. Put 1 teaspoon of olive oil in a frying pan on a medium heat. Pick the rosemary leaves over the chicken and lightly season it on both sides, flattening it slightly with the heel of your hand. Cook for 4 minutes on each side, or until golden and cooked through.
1. Cube the bread and toast alongside the chicken, moving regularly until evenly golden and gnarly, removing only when super-crispy.
1. Toss the salad together and season to perfection, slice up the chicken and serve with a sprinkling of croutons and lemon wedges for squeezing over.
