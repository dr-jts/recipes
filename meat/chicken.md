## Chicken Cacciatore

* 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
* 6 bone-in skinless chicken thighs
* Salt and pepper, to season
* 1 medium onion, diced
* 2 tablespoons minced garlic, (or 6 cloves)
* 1 small red bell pepper (capsicum), diced
* 1 large carrot, peeled and sliced
* 10 oz (300g) mushrooms, sliced
* 8 sprigs thyme
* 2 tablespoons each freshly chopped parsley and basil plus more to garnish
* 1 teaspoon dried oregano
* 150 ml red wine

* 28 oz (820g) crushed tomatoes
* 2 tablespoons tomato paste
* 7 oz (200g) Roma tomatoes, halved
* 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes

1. Season chicken with salt and pepper. 
1. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a heavy cast iron skillet. Sear chicken on both sides until golden, about 3-4 minutes each side. Remove from skillet and set aside.
1. Add remaining oil to the pan. Sauté the onion until transparent, about 3-4 minutes. Add in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. 
2. Add the peppers, carrot, mushrooms and herbs; cook for 5 minutes until vegetables begin to soften.
3. Pour in the wine, scraping up browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Cook until wine is reduced, about 2 minutes.
4. Add crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, Roma tomatoes and chill flakes. Season with salt and pepper to your tastes. Return chicken pieces to the skillet and continue to cook over stove top OR in the oven following the instructions below.
5. FOR STOVE TOP: Mix all of the ingredients together; cover with lid, reduce heat to low and allow to simmer (while stirring occasionally) for 40 minutes or until the meat is falling off the bone. 
6. FOR THE OVEN: Transfer the covered skillet to a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) and cook for 50 minutes. Remove the lid and cook for an additional 20 minutes until the chicken is tender and falling off the bone, and the sauce has reduced.
