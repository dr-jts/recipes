## Hungrian Mushroom Soup

* 4 tablespoons of salted butter
* 1 ½ cups white onions, chopped
* 1 lb. mushrooms, sliced (use crimini, button, etc.)
* 2 teaspoons dried dill weed
* 1 teaspoon EACH: dried thyme AND dried mushroom powder (optional)
* 1 tablespoon EACH: sweet paprika AND lemon juice
* 2 cloves garlic, grated
* 2 ½ cups low sodium chicken stock (or vegetable)
* 2 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce
* 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
* 1 cup half and half (or whole milk)
* ⅓ cup room-temperature creme fraiche (or sour cream)
* 3 tablespoons chopped parsley

1. In a dutch oven or soup pot, saute the onions and mushrooms in the butter over medium heat for
5 minutes.
1. Then, season with dill, thyme, and paprika and allow the mushrooms and onions to continue
cooking for an additional 7-10 minutes, stirring often.
1. Sprinkle the grated garlic and mushroom powder 30 seconds before the mushrooms are done.
1. Slowly pour in the chicken stock, soy sauce, and lemon juice and scrape the bottom of the
pot to loosen anything that might be stuck on.
1. Allow the soup to gain a simmer and then let cook and reduce for 5 minutes.
1. While the soup is reducing, whisk together the milk and flour in a small bowl until smooth (you
can also just shake it all in a mason jar.)
1. Pour the mixture into the soup and continue to cook the soup for 8-10 minutes, or until the
soup thickens, stirring as required.
1. Remove the soup from heat.
1. Stir the soup while you add in the sour cream slowly and allow for it to mix.

garlic!
