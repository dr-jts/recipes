Full Recipe
Half Recipe
1 c Unsalted Butter (softened)
1 1/2 c Sugar
2 large Eggs
2 t Vanilla

2 3/4 c Flour
1 1/2 t Cream of Tartar
1/2 t Baking Soda
1 t Salt

Cinnamon-Sugar Mixture:
1/4 c Sugar
1 1/2 T Cinnamon
1/2 c Unsalted Butter (softened)

1 t Vanilla

1 3/8 c Flour
3/4 t Cream of Tartar
1/4 t Baking Soda
1/2 t Salt

Cinnamon-Sugar Mixture:
1/8 c Sugar

Roll into small balls until round and smooth.  Drop into the cinnamon-sugar mixture and coat well. Using a spoon, coat for a second time, ensuring the cookie balls are completely covered.  *To make flatter snickerdoodles, press down in the center of the ball before placing in the oven. This helps to keep them from puffing up in the middle.

Let cool for several minutes on baking sheet before removing from the pan.

Cakes
Orange Almond Cake (GF)
2 large oranges (preferably seedless navels)
6 eggs
1 1/2 cups ground almonds
Pinch salt
1 cup sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
GARNISH: Thin slices of peeled orange sprinkled with confectioners’ sugar and a touch of cinnamon, or fresh raspberries. Serve with whipped cream.
Wash the oranges and boil them in water to cover, without peeling, until very soft, about 30 minutes (MD - 60 mins ???). Drain, cool, cut into quarters, and remove the seeds, if any. Process the oranges to a fairly fine purée in a blender or food processor or by putting them through a meat grinder. Don’t make it too fine. The little bits of skin, which will not be at all bitter after the long boiling, are pleasant to bite on.

Beat the eggs in a bowl until thick, then add the ground almonds, salt, sugar, baking powder, and orange purée, and mix well. Line a deep 9-inch round cake pan with parchment paper. Butter and flour the parchment paper. Pour the cake batter into the pan and bake in a 400ºF (MD - 350F ???) oven for 1 hour or longer, until firm to the touch when pressed with the tip of your finger.
Remove the pan to a rack, allow the cake to cool, then turn it out of the pan onto a serving dish. 

Serve garnished with orange slices or berries, and whipped cream.

OPTIONS
Some recommend separating the eggs and beating yolk and white separately

Nectarine Upside-Down Cake

3/4 cup plain Greek yogurt
1/2 cup (1 stick) butter
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon almond extract
1 cup sugar
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
2-3 nectarines, sliced into wedges

DIRECTIONS:
Preheat oven to 350F.  Coat an 8- or 9-inch springform pan with nonstick vegetable spray (both bottom and sides).
Add the butter to a large glass mixing bowl and microwave in 30 second increments until melted.  Whisk in the Greek yogurt, eggs, vanilla extract, and almond extract.  Once smooth, whisk in the sugar.
Switch to a rubber spatula and fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients, just until combined.
Arrange the sliced nectarines along the bottom of the springform pan.  Pour the batter over top of the sliced fruit and smooth the top with the rubber spatula.
Bake for 40 minutes, or until golden brown and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean.
Allow the cake to cool for 5-10 minutes, then remove the sides of the springform pan and invert onto a wire cooling rack.  Carefully lift the bottom of the pan off the top of the cake, sliding a long knife along the pan bottom to loosen any fruit that may have stuck.
Store in an airtight container at room temperature for 3 to 4 days.
