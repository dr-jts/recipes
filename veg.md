Healthy Chicken Caesar
Ingredients
1 lemon
15 g Parmesan cheese
2 anchovy fillets in oil
4 heaped tablespoons natural yoghurt
½ teaspoon English mustard
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
white wine vinegar
extra virgin olive oil
1 small red onion
½ a small cauliflower (300g)
1 romaine lettuce
olive oil
1 sprig of fresh rosemary
2 x 120 g free-range skinless chicken breasts
1 thick slice of wholemeal bread

Method
Finely grate the lemon zest and Parmesan into a large bowl. Slice and add the anchovies, along with the yoghurt, mustard and Worcestershire sauce.
Squeeze in half the lemon juice, add 1 tablespoon of vinegar and 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and mix to make your dressing.
Now you’re going to turn regular salad into a thing of beauty by either taking your time with good knife skills, or ideally, investing in a mandolin for ease, elegance and accuracy (use the guard!). Start by peeling and very finely slicing the red onion, then stir it through the dressing.
Click off and discard any tatty outer leaves from the cauliflower, then very finely slice it. Finely slice the lettuce by hand and pile both on top of the dressed onion, tossing together only moments before serving.
Put 1 teaspoon of olive oil in a frying pan on a medium heat. Pick the rosemary leaves over the chicken and lightly season it on both sides, flattening it slightly with the heel of your hand. Cook for 4 minutes on each side, or until golden and cooked through.
Cube the bread and toast alongside the chicken, moving regularly until evenly golden and gnarly, removing only when super-crispy.
Toss the salad together and season to perfection, slice up the chicken and serve with a sprinkling of croutons and lemon wedges for squeezing over.
Asian Broccoli Salad

INGREDIENTS:
BROCCOLI SALAD INGREDIENTS:
1 large head broccoli, cut into small florets
1 cup shelled cooked edamame
1/2 cup thinly-sliced green onions
1/2 cup peanuts
1 batch peanut sauce (recipe below)

TO MAKE THE BROCCOLI SALAD:
Heat a large pot of water until it is boiling.  Add in the broccoli florets and boil for 30 seconds.

TO MAKE THE PEANUT SAUCE:
Whisk all ingredients together until combined. If the dressing is too thick, whisk in hot water a tablespoon at a time until it reaches the consistency you desire.

 1/2 teaspoon pepper
 one 15-ounce can black beans, drained and rinsed
 3 green onions, trimmed and thinly sliced (use the white and green)

 2 tablespoons honey
 2 tablespoons dijon mustard
 2 tablespoons lemon juice OR lime juice
 2 tablespoons olive oil
 1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste

Evenly drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil, season with salt and pepper, and bake for about 45 minutes, or until fork-tender and done. Halfway through baking flip potatoes to ensure even cooking. Baking time will vary based on size of potatoes, oven and climate variances, and I recommend starting to check at 30 minutes for doneness.

Quinoa Salad
Mexican Quinoa Salad

If you are working with frozen corn, you can add more flavor by taking the frozen corn kernels and searing them directly on a hot pan, without defrosting first. Save time by prepping most of the ingredients while the quinoa is cooking.
Prep time: 15 minutes
Cook time: 25 minutes
Yield: Serves 4-6

1 cup uncooked quinoa, well rinsed
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups water
1/3 cup diced red onion
2 Tbsp lime juice
1 15-ounce can black beans, drained and rinsed
1 cup frozen corn, defrosted, OR 1 cup of fresh corn, parboiled, drained and cooled (approximately the amount of kernels from one ear of corn)
3 medium tomatoes, seeded and cut into chunks
5 ounces Queso fresco, Queso Panela, fresh Mozzarella or other mild farmer's cheese, cut into 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch cubes
1 jalapeño, seeded and finely chopped
1/4 cup chopped cilantro, including tender stems, packed
3 Tbsp olive oil
Put the rinsed quinoa, salt and water into a pot and bring it to a boil. Cover and simmer gently until the quinoa absorbs all the water, about 10-15 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit for 5 minutes. Place into a large bowl and fluff up with a fork to help it cool more quickly.
While the quinoa is cooking, prepare the rest of the salad. Soak the red onions in the lime juice and set aside. Soaking the onions in lime juice (or lemon juice or water) helps take the edge off of them. Mix the prepped black beans, corn kernels, tomatoes, cheese, jalapenos, cilantro, and oil into a large bowl.
When the quinoa has cooled, mix it into the bean mixture. Add the red onion and the lime juice and add salt, more oil or lime juice to taste. Serve at room temperature.

Rice Salad
INGREDIENTS
3 to 4 cups cooked rice, cooled
1/4 cup chopped scallion
1 small or 1/2 large red or yellow bell pepper, cored, seeded, and chopped
1/2 cup chopped celery
1/2 cup chopped carrot
1/4 to 1/2 cup Vinaigrette, made with extra virgin olive oil and red wine vinegar, plus more as needed
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
Salt and freshly ground black pepper

PREPARATION
Put the rice and all the vegetables in a large bowl. Drizzle with vinaigrette and use two big forks to combine, fluffing the rice and tossing gently to separate the grains.
Stir in the parsley, taste, and adjust the seasoning or moisten with a little more dressing. Serve at room temperature or refrigerate for up to a day, bringing the salad back to room temperature before serving.

Variations:

Rice Salad, Japanese Style: Use brown or white short-grain rice. Halve the amount of celery and carrot and finely chop them or shred them on a grater. Add 1 cup cubed firm tofu (preferably baked). Instead of the vinaigrette, toss with 1/4 cup or so of Simple Miso Dipping Sauce (made by whisking together 6 tablespoons miso paste, 3/4 cup warm water or sake, 1 teaspoon sugar, 1 tablespoon mirin or honey, 1 tablespoon rice vinegar plus more to taste, and salt to taste). Instead of the parsley, crumble 2 sheets of nori over the rice salad and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons black or white sesame seeds.

Rice Salad, Mexican Style: Long-grain or medium-grain, white or brown, all work well here. When blending the vinaigrette, add 1 tablespoon chili powder and 2 tablespoons Mexican crema or mayonnaise. Instead of celery and carrot, add 1 cup chopped fresh tomato. Substitute chopped fresh cilantro for the parsley and, at the same time, add 2 chopped hard-cooked eggs and chopped jalapeño chiles if you like. Serve with lime wedges.

Rice Salad, Indian Style: Use brown or white basmati rice. When making the vinaigrette, use rice wine vinegar, replace the oil with coconut milk, and add 1 tablespoon curry powder, or more to taste. Instead of the bell pepper, celery, and carrot, add 1/2 cup each cubed cooked potato, cooked cauliflower florets, and green peas (cooked frozen are fine). Substitute cilantro for the parsley.

Citrus Rice Salad: Use any rice. Instead of red wine vinegar, make the vinaigrette with freshly squeezed citrus juice—choose from lemon, lime, orange, blood orange, tangerine, pink grapefruit, or a combination. Whatever you use, add 2 tablespoons of the grated zest and 1 tablespoon of sugar or honey to the blender. Do not include the scallion or the vegetables. (You might want to use a little less dressing.) Instead of the parsley, use mint if you like. A handful of chopped almonds or pecans make a nice addition.

Tomato Rice Salad: Use any kind of brown or white rice. When making the vinaigrette, eliminate the vinegar and add 1 medium tomato to the blender. Instead of the scallion and other vegetables, add 2 cups chopped fresh tomato (a mixture of heirloom varieties is nice).Instead of the parsley, use chopped fresh basil or mint, or 1/4 cup chopped fresh chives, chervil, dill, or about a tablespoon of fresh thyme leaves.

Roast broccoli and blue‑cheese bake
A quick and comforting dish that balances the sharp and salty flavours of the blue cheese with fruity and nutty parmesan.

Serves 3-4

350g penne
250g roasted broccoli
100g blue cheese
50g breadcrumbs
50g parmesan

For the sauce
50g butter
40g plain flour
400ml milk
150g stilton or other blue cheese
1 tbsp dijon mustard
Salt and black pepper

Boil the pasta with a pinch of salt until al dente. Meanwhile, make the sauce.
Put the butter in a heavy-based pan and heat it gently until it foams and starts to lightly brown. Pour the flour in and stir to form a light-brown roux. Cook the flour for a minute or so, then add the milk. Whisk well to incorporate and bring to a simmer. The sauce will look a little lumpy, but as the milk comes up to temperature the sauce will come together to create a rich base.
Once the sauce has thickened, stir in the blue cheese, dijon mustard, salt and pepper, then allow the cheese to melt in. Taste and adjust the seasoning, if needed.
Preheat the oven to 350F. Drain the pasta, then add it to the pan with the blue-cheese sauce. Give it a thorough mix and then fold in the roasted broccoli. Transfer this into a ceramic roasting dish, crumble with the remaining blue cheese, sprinkle with the breadcrumbs and grate the parmesan on top.
Place in the oven for 25-30 minutes, until the top is golden brown. Serve with a light leafy salad.

1/3 cup butter
3 tablespoons honey
4 garlic cloves minced
1/4-1/2 teaspoon salt plus more for seasoning
Cracked black pepper
2 tablespoons fresh chopped parsley
INSTRUCTIONS
Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Lightly grease a large baking sheet with nonstick cooking oil spray; set aside.
Trim ends of carrots and cut into thirds.
Melt butter in a pan or skillet over medium-heat. Pour in honey and cook, while stirring, until completely melted through the butter. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds until fragrant while stirring.
Add the carrots and allow the sauce to thicken for a further minute, while tossing the carrots through the sauce. Season with salt and pepper. 
Transfer carrots to baking sheet in a single layer so they cook evenly. Toss to evenly coat.
Roast for 20 minutes, or until carrots are fork-tender. Broil (or grill) for 2-3 minutes on high heat to crisp/char the edges.
OPTIONAL: Transfer them back into the skillet and allow carrots to simmer in the sauce over high heat for 5 minutes to thicken the sauce into a glaze. *SEE NOTES.
Season with a little extra salt and pepper if desired. Garnish with parsley.

Potatoes
Nugget Potatoes with Smoked Salmon, Mustard Cream and Chives

Serve these tapas-like bites at brunch or before a late spring or summer dinner with a glass of sparkling B.C. wine.

Preparation: 20 minutes
Cooking time: About 10 minutes
Makes: 18 pieces

9 small nugget potatoes

1/4 cup sour cream
2 tsp Dijon mustard
1 tsp honey

9 slices cold smoked salmon, each halved
• freshly ground black pepper to taste
36 (1-inch long) pieces fresh chive

 
Boil the potatoes until just tender, about 10 minutes. Drain well, set on a large plate and cool to room temperature.

Cut each potato in half and set, cut-side up, on a serving plate. If needed, trim a little from the bottom of each potato if they don’t sit flat.

Place the sour cream, mustard and honey in a small bowl and mix until smooth. (The potatoes and mustard cream can be prepared a few hours before needed. Cover and refrigerate both until ready to top and serve the potatoes.)

To serve, top each potato with a small spoon of the mustard cream. Now twist and artfully set a half slice of smoked salmon on each potato. Top the salmon on each potato with two pieces of chive and serve.

 
Hot Nugget Potatoes with Pesto and Parmesan

Steaming nugget potatoes tossed with rich presto and tangy cheese. Makes a nice side dish for grilled lamb and kebabs. Use freshly grated Parmesan for this, not the dried, powdered type, as the former will deliciously melt and cling to the potatoes when it’s sprinkled on them.

Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: about 10 minutes
Makes: six servings


2 lb. nugget potatoes, rinsed and halved
1/2 tsp salt, plus some to taste
1/3 cup homemade or store-bought pesto
1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste
• freshly ground black pepper to taste

Cut potatoes into quarters or halves and place in a pot. Cover with cold water and sprinkle in the 1/2 tsp salt. Boil the potatoes until just tender, about 8 to 10 minutes, and then drain well and place in a bowl.

Toss the potatoes with pesto, a bit more salt, pepper and half the cheese, and then spoon into a serving dish. Top with the remaining cheese and dig in.

Nugget Potato Salad with Chive and Bacon Ranch Dressing

This recipe, which I first published back in 2007, is still one of my favourite ways to prepare nugget potatoes when the weather’s warm. That’s because it makes a nice side dish for just about anything cooked outside on the barbecue, such as burgers, chicken and salmon.

Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: about 10 minutes
Makes: six servings

2 lb. nugget potatoes, rinsed
1/2 tsp salt, plus some to taste

1/3 cup mayonnaise
1/3 cup buttermilk
1/2 tsp sugar
1 Tbsp white wine vinegar
4 slices bacon, diced, cooked crispy and drained well
1 Tbsp snipped fresh chives
• freshly ground black pepper to taste

2 ribs of celery, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced
1 medium carrot, coarsely grated

Cut potatoes into quarters or halves and place in a pot. Cover with cold water and sprinkle in the 1/2 tsp salt. Boil the potatoes until just tender, about 8 to 10 minutes, and then drain well, spread out on a baking sheet and cool to room temperature.

Place the mayonnaise, buttermilk, sugar and vinegar in a salad bowl and whisk to combine. Stir in the bacon and chives; season with salt and pepper to taste. When the potatoes have cooled to room temperature, add them and the celery and carrot to the salad and toss to combine. Cover the salad and chill well in the refrigerator before serving.
