## Pork Chops with Maple-Dijon glaze

* 4 boneless thick-cut pork chops
* 1 1/2 Tbsp. olive oil, divided
* 1/4 cup pure maple sryup
* 1/4 cup Dijon mustard
* 1/2 Tbsp. apple cider vinegar
* 1/2 Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce
* 1 clove garlic, finely minced
* 1/4 tsp. kosher salt

1. Preheat skillet to medium heat. 
2. Remove pork chops from the refrigerator to take the chill off of them. 
3. Meanwhile, whisk together 1/2 tablespoon olive oil and remaining ingredients. Set aside.
4. Drizzle skillet with the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Season pork chops lightly with salt and pepper. Sear each side, 3 to 4 minutes, until golden brown. 
5. Brush pork chops with maple Dijon glaze and flip often, every minute or two, to avoid burning. 
6. Cook until internal temperature has reached 145 degrees F. Remove from skillet and let rest for 5 minutes before cutting.
