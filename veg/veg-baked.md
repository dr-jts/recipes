## Roasted Broccoli and Blue Cheese
A quick and comforting dish that balances the sharp and salty flavours of the blue cheese with fruity and nutty parmesan.

Serves 3-4

* 350g penne
* 250g roasted broccoli
* 100g blue cheese
* 50g breadcrumbs
* 50g parmesan

For the sauce
* 50g butter
* 40g plain flour
* 400ml milk
* 150g stilton or other blue cheese
* 1 tbsp dijon mustard
* Salt and black pepper

1. Boil the pasta with a pinch of salt until al dente. Meanwhile, make the sauce.
1. Put the butter in a heavy-based pan and heat it gently until it foams and starts to lightly brown. Pour the flour in and stir to form a light-brown roux. Cook the flour for a minute or so, then add the milk. Whisk well to incorporate and bring to a simmer. The sauce will look a little lumpy, but as the milk comes up to temperature the sauce will come together to create a rich base.
1. Once the sauce has thickened, stir in the blue cheese, dijon mustard, salt and pepper, then allow the cheese to melt in. Taste and adjust the seasoning, if needed.
1. Preheat the oven to 350F. Drain the pasta, then add it to the pan with the blue-cheese sauce. Give it a thorough mix and then fold in the roasted broccoli. Transfer this into a ceramic roasting dish, crumble with the remaining blue cheese, sprinkle with the breadcrumbs and grate the parmesan on top.
1. Place in the oven for 25-30 minutes, until the top is golden brown. Serve with a light leafy salad.
