## Maple-Glazed Carrots

SERVES 8

12 large carrots, peeled
8 tbsp. butter
¼ cup maple syrup
Fresh lemon juice
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp. fresh thyme leaves
 
1. Cut carrots into 2" lengths, then halve or quarter the pieces lengthwise so that all the carrots are in equal-size strips.

2. Melt butter in a large heavy sauté pan over medium-low heat. Add carrots, cover, and braise, stirring occasionally, until carrots are fork-tender, 20–30 minutes.

3.Increase heat to medium, and stir in syrup and a squeeze of lemon juice. Cook for 2 minutes, then season to taste with salt and pepper. Add thyme and mix well.

## Sauteed Brussels Sprouts

Brussels Sprouts
Olive oil
Kosher Salt
Black Pepper
Acid - Balsamic vinegar or lemon juice

Heat the oil in a large, heavy bottom skillet (a cast iron pan is a good choice), then add your Brussels sprouts. Cook undisturbed until caramelized.
Add spices and stir. Continue to cook and stir until the Brussels sprouts are deep dark golden brown.
Remove from the heat, and stir in the vinegar. Finish the sprouts off any way you like: a handful of Parmesan cheese, nuts, or herbs, or simply enjoy them just as the are. Serve hot and DIG IN!

## Potatoes

### Nugget Potatoes with Smoked Salmon, Mustard Cream and Chives

Serve these tapas-like bites at brunch or before a late spring or summer dinner with a glass of sparkling B.C. wine.

Preparation: 20 minutes
Cooking time: About 10 minutes
Makes: 18 pieces

9 small nugget potatoes

1/4 cup sour cream
2 tsp Dijon mustard
1 tsp honey

9 slices cold smoked salmon, each halved
• freshly ground black pepper to taste
36 (1-inch long) pieces fresh chive

 
Boil the potatoes until just tender, about 10 minutes. Drain well, set on a large plate and cool to room temperature.

Cut each potato in half and set, cut-side up, on a serving plate. If needed, trim a little from the bottom of each potato if they don’t sit flat.

Place the sour cream, mustard and honey in a small bowl and mix until smooth. (The potatoes and mustard cream can be prepared a few hours before needed. Cover and refrigerate both until ready to top and serve the potatoes.)

To serve, top each potato with a small spoon of the mustard cream. Now twist and artfully set a half slice of smoked salmon on each potato. Top the salmon on each potato with two pieces of chive and serve.

 
### Hot Nugget Potatoes with Pesto and Parmesan

Steaming nugget potatoes tossed with rich presto and tangy cheese. Makes a nice side dish for grilled lamb and kebabs. Use freshly grated Parmesan for this, not the dried, powdered type, as the former will deliciously melt and cling to the potatoes when it’s sprinkled on them.

Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: about 10 minutes
Makes: six servings


2 lb. nugget potatoes, rinsed and halved
1/2 tsp salt, plus some to taste
1/3 cup homemade or store-bought pesto
1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste
• freshly ground black pepper to taste

Cut potatoes into quarters or halves and place in a pot. Cover with cold water and sprinkle in the 1/2 tsp salt. Boil the potatoes until just tender, about 8 to 10 minutes, and then drain well and place in a bowl.

Toss the potatoes with pesto, a bit more salt, pepper and half the cheese, and then spoon into a serving dish. Top with the remaining cheese and dig in.

### Nugget Potato Salad with Chive and Bacon Ranch Dressing

This recipe, which I first published back in 2007, is still one of my favourite ways to prepare nugget potatoes when the weather’s warm. That’s because it makes a nice side dish for just about anything cooked outside on the barbecue, such as burgers, chicken and salmon.

Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: about 10 minutes
Makes: six servings

2 lb. nugget potatoes, rinsed
1/2 tsp salt, plus some to taste

1/3 cup mayonnaise
1/3 cup buttermilk
1/2 tsp sugar
1 Tbsp white wine vinegar
4 slices bacon, diced, cooked crispy and drained well
1 Tbsp snipped fresh chives
• freshly ground black pepper to taste

2 ribs of celery, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced
1 medium carrot, coarsely grated

Cut potatoes into quarters or halves and place in a pot. Cover with cold water and sprinkle in the 1/2 tsp salt. Boil the potatoes until just tender, about 8 to 10 minutes, and then drain well, spread out on a baking sheet and cool to room temperature.

Place the mayonnaise, buttermilk, sugar and vinegar in a salad bowl and whisk to combine. Stir in the bacon and chives; season with salt and pepper to taste. When the potatoes have cooled to room temperature, add them and the celery and carrot to the salad and toss to combine. Cover the salad and chill well in the refrigerator before serving.
Roast Potatoes
