## Blue Moon Cocktail

* 1 cup crushed ice
* 1/4 cup vodka
* 1/4 cup blue curaçao
* 1/4 cup whipping cream
* 2 tablespoons vanilla-flavored syrup (such as Torani)
* 2 tablespoons fresh orange juice
* 1 tablespoon Cointreau or other orange-flavored liqueur

1. Combine all ingredients in a blender, and whirl until smooth.
2. Pour into four martini glasses (4 oz.)
3. Garnish the rim of each glass with a slice of orange.

## Whiskey Sour
* 2 ounces bourbon or rye whiskey
* ¾ ounce fresh lemon juice (freshly squeezed is key for flavor)
* ½ ounce simple syrup (adjust to taste, more for sweeter, less for tarter)
* ½ ounce egg white (optional, for a frothy, silky texture)
* Garnish: Angostura bitters, a maraschino cherry, and/or an orange slice/peel 

1. Add the whiskey, lemon juice, simple syrup, and egg white (if using) to a cocktail shaker.
2. Dry Shake (if using egg white): Seal the shaker and shake vigorously for 10–30 seconds without ice. This aerates the egg white to create a rich foam.
1. Wet Shake: Fill the shaker with ice and shake again for 15–20 seconds, until well-chilled.
1. Strain and Serve:
  1. On the rocks: Strain the mixture into a rocks glass filled with fresh ice.
  1. Served "up": Strain the mixture into a chilled coupe or cocktail glass without ice.
1. Garnish with a few drops of Angostura bitters on the foam, and an orange slice and/or a maraschino cherry.
