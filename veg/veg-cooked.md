## Potatoes

### Nugget Potatoes with Smoked Salmon, Mustard Cream and Chives

Serve these tapas-like bites at brunch or before a late spring or summer dinner with a glass of sparkling B.C. wine.

Preparation: 20 minutes
Cooking time: About 10 minutes
Makes: 18 pieces

* 9 small nugget potatoes
* 1/4 cup sour cream
* 2 tsp Dijon mustard
* 1 tsp honey
* 9 slices cold smoked salmon, each halved
* freshly ground black pepper to taste
* 36 (1-inch long) pieces fresh chive

 
1. Boil the potatoes until just tender, about 10 minutes. Drain well, set on a large plate and cool to room temperature.
1. Cut each potato in half and set, cut-side up, on a serving plate. If needed, trim a little from the bottom of each potato if they don’t sit flat.
1. Place the sour cream, mustard and honey in a small bowl and mix until smooth. (The potatoes and mustard cream can be prepared a few hours before needed. Cover and refrigerate both until ready to top and serve the potatoes.)
1. To serve, top each potato with a small spoon of the mustard cream. Now twist and artfully set a half slice of smoked salmon on each potato. Top the salmon on each potato with two pieces of chive and serve.

 
### Hot Nugget Potatoes with Pesto and Parmesan

Steaming nugget potatoes tossed with rich presto and tangy cheese. Makes a nice side dish for grilled lamb and kebabs. Use freshly grated Parmesan for this, not the dried, powdered type, as the former will deliciously melt and cling to the potatoes when it’s sprinkled on them.

Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: about 10 minutes
Makes: six servings


* 2 lb. nugget potatoes, rinsed and halved
* 1/2 tsp salt, plus some to taste
* 1/3 cup homemade or store-bought pesto
* 1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste
* freshly ground black pepper to taste

1. Cut potatoes into quarters or halves and place in a pot. Cover with cold water and sprinkle in the 1/2 tsp salt. Boil the potatoes until just tender, about 8 to 10 minutes, and then drain well and place in a bowl.
1. Toss the potatoes with pesto, a bit more salt, pepper and half the cheese, and then spoon into a serving dish. Top with the remaining cheese and dig in.
