## Best Sugar Cookies

 2 cups Sweet Cream Salted Butter (softened)
 2 cups Sugar
 2 Eggs
 2 T Vanilla
 4 t Baking Powder
 6 cups Flour

Add butter and sugar to your mixer.  Cream the butter and sugar until completely mixed. Do not over-mix.
Add vanilla and eggs and mix until completely incorporated.
Add Baking Powder and mix.
Mix in the flour two cups at a time. If the mixture seems dry or crumbly add a small amount of vanilla or milk.
Do not chill the dough, the cookies will bake better if the dough is at room temperature.
Roll a handful of the dough out on a prepared surface until it's about 3/8" thick and cut out shapes with a cookie cutter.
Bake at 350 degrees for 6-8 minutes depending on the size of the cookie. Do not over-bake!

## Snickerdoodles


### Full Recipe
1 c Unsalted Butter (softened)
1 1/2 c Sugar
2 large Eggs
2 t Vanilla

2 3/4 c Flour
1 1/2 t Cream of Tartar
1/2 t Baking Soda
1 t Salt

**Cinnamon-Sugar Mixture**
1/4 c Sugar
1 1/2 T Cinnamon

### Half Recipe
1/2 c Unsalted Butter (softened)
3/4 c Sugar
1 large Egg
1 t Vanilla

1 3/8 c Flour
3/4 t Cream of Tartar
1/4 t Baking Soda
1/2 t Salt

**Cinnamon-Sugar Mixture**
1/8 c Sugar
¾ T Cinnamon

Heat oven to 350 degrees.
In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar for 4-5 minutes until light and fluffy.  
Add the eggs and vanilla. Cream for 1-2 minutes longer. 
Stir in flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt, just until combined. 
In a small bowl, stir together sugar and cinnamon. 
If time allows, wrap the dough and let refrigerate for 20-30 minutes.  
Roll into small balls until round and smooth.  
Drop into the cinnamon-sugar mixture and coat well. 
Using a spoon, coat for a second time, ensuring the cookie balls are completely covered.  
To make flatter snickerdoodles, press down in the center of the ball before placing in the oven. This helps to keep them from puffing up in the middle. 
Place on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. 
Bake for 9 - 11 minutes.  (perhaps 13 mins)
Let cool for several minutes on baking sheet before removing from the pan.
