## Candied Orange Peel

* 3 large oranges (can also use the equivalent of lemons, grapefruits, limes; organic is recommended)
* 2 c sugar
* 1 c water (or up to 3 cups?)
* Fine granulated sugar for coating
 
1. Thoroughly wash and scrub fruit
1. Slice both ends of the citrus fruits. Cut the peel on each each into 4 or more vertical segments, depending on the size of the fruit. Peel off each segment of rind. (You can remove a little of the white pith, though not necessary. The pith is bitter but the blanching process below will help reduce the bitterness. Note that if you remove the white pith, the thinner the peels are the harder and more leathery they will be when they’re candied.) Slice the peels into 1/4 inch wide strips. (Keep the peeled fruit for eating, cooking, juicing, etc)
1. Boil peels in a pot of water for 15 minutes. Drain the peels in a colander, rinse and then drain again. 
1. Repeat this process one or two more times to reduce the bitter flavor.
1. Put 1 cup water and sugar in pot and bring to boil. Boil 2 minutes until the sugar is dissolved.
2. Add citrus peels, reduce heat to low and simmer for 45-60 minutes.  Stir occasionally until the peels become translucent and the syrup becomes lightly syrupy (on a candy thermometer this will be be approximately soft ball stage or 235-240 F).
1. Use a slotted spoon to remove a few of the peels at a time and let the excess syrup drip off for a few seconds.
2. Place the hot, wet peels in a bowl of sugar or a ziplock bag with sugar in it and toss/shake to coat.
3. Spread the candied citrus peels out on a wire rack to cool and dry completely, 1-2 days. *Note: Tossing them in sugar and letting them dry is only necessary if you're storing them at room temp for an extended period of time. They can be used immediately in any recipe that calls for them. And any leftovers can be put in a freezer bag/container and frozen as is until the next time you need them.

Can dip in chocolate, or use in shortbread or other baking
